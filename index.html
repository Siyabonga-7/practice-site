      <h3><u>The start of it all</u></h3>
      <p class="first-paragraph">Well, I am not sure where to even begin to share my journey with you, but here goes.</p>
      <p class="second-paragraph">Well thus far it has not been the easiest orney in learning how to code but I can say it has been the most interest experience I have had this year, and I am really excited to explore more and what i can learn in this tech industry. I am willing to learn as much as I can, dare i say i will even try to learn all there is to learn in this feild for whatever relavant tools I will need to learn.</p>
        <h2 id="main">Main</h2>
        <h3><u>The challanges</u></h3>
        <p class="third-paragraph">Well it has not been the smoothest journey thus far and I am not holding my breath hoping it only gets easier from here, as I a fully expecting for my journey in coding to get more and more complecated as the time goes and with the more I learn but what I am counting on is that it will be all worth it at the end. Armed with the hope that there is always liught at the end of the tunnel I am prepared to struggle to learn the code and aim to succeed in this field.</p>
        <p class="fourth-paragraph">One of the deepest challanges that I have faced and I am still faced with is the struggles of learning to code in a non-school environment. Learning to code by means of being self taught is not anymore diffincult than learning to code in a university nor would you learn any less than a peson that went to university, but the thing that I struggle with is that most businesses in this fild tend to prefer people that have a degree in coding and being self taught, well you would not have a degree, yes there are a number of self taught devs out there that didn't go to a university, but being in South Africa, there aren't that many job that do not require a degree, however I am not deterred in my pursuit of learning code, I am still continuing as this site will be sort of like a checkpoint in my journey to learn code, I will most probably make another page like this in the near future.</p>
